            <div class="small-font">Hi! My name is Kevin and I am a current undergraduate student at Rutgers University - New Brunswick pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I'm a fan of computer hardware, I have a passion for writing, and I love turning my ideas into reality with the power of computer science. I'm currently looking for an internship in the field of web development/object-oriented programming.</div>

                        <p class="card-text">Back when I was in middle school, there were a variety of free-to-use Kahoot bots on the Chrome web store and on various websites that would flood a game with dozens and dozens of bot players. By the time high school rolled around, one bot creator decided to monetize his/her product, and soon enough, everyone tagged along. Without any free options to troll my classes with, I decided to create a simple, concise, and inconspicuous Kahoot bot with Python. With the power of the selenium webdriver API, it's less than 50 lines of code!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">As an avid Old School RuneScape player, monitoring the economy is always on my mind. Whether it's buying a new best-in-slot piece of gear, or just flipping some resources, price tracking is always involved. Looking to invest in some very expensive items in-game, I wanted to know by what percentage each item dropped/increased every day. Using the BeautifulSoup web scraper in conjunction with Google's spreadsheet API, I was able to automate price checks and analyze the price trends for my own investment decisions.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The Zulrah GUI is the product of my slight frustrations with Zulrah helpers for the Old School RuneScape boss, Zulrah. Though they functioned fine as GUIs, they didn't include a few crucial details about the boss fight's phases. Having already created my own rotation diagrams for the boss fight, I decided to create my own solution to this problem. I did some research on Python GUIs and ended up utilizing the Tkinter GUI API to create a fully functioning GUI that would show individual rotations depending on the in-game rotations of the boss fight.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Since I've been writing blog posts since high school, working on the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences Program blog team has been a great experience. I get to work with several other enthusiastic writers to prepare weekly blog posts on an assortment of topics. We're always writing&mdash;whether it's about student life in remote learning, how we think spring break will turn out during a global pandemic, or anything our minds are on! Besides writing, we're also featured in the SASHP newsletter and work on ideas for furthering the SASHP's reach.</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Medium Blog</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Though my first blog posts were on a Wordpress site that is no longer hosted, my first website that I built from scratch had a few blog posts on them. However, writing directly into VSCode was not the best experience. Though it gave me complete control, it also came with its inconveniences, so I decided to move my blogging to Medium, where I write about everything from PC building to big O in programming. My articles have been published to multiple publications, including The Startup, Medium's largest active publication, with over 750k followers.</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Personal Website</h5>
                        <p class="card-text"><strong>piercetheheavens.ga</strong> is a domain that I purchased to continue the legacy of my first website, which I created in the summer before my freshman year with Wordpress. The Pierce the Heavens Project featured several of my projects involving space exploration, artificial intelligence, and environmental sustainability. The several blog posts on that site started off my passion for writing, which I'm currently continuing with the Rutgers SASHP blog and my personal Medium blog. Built entirely from scratch, the new Pierce the Heavens website has served as an incredible opportunity for me to learn HTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript through the blog, animations, and the little games that I've built in.</p>
